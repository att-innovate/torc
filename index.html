<h1 id="torc-top-of-rack-controller">ToRC - Top of Rack Controller</h1>
<p>Low-Latency Computing at the Edge of the Network - Applications, Services, and Network Functions controlled by a Top-of-Rack Switch.</p>
<p><img alt="demo-reference-setup" src="./assets/demo-reference-setup.png" /></p>
<p>This project should serve as a blueprint, as a reference architecture for everyone interested in controlling resources in a compute rack from its TOR switch.</p>
<p>We open sourced all the scripts to set it up, plus all the software pieces written by us. A detailed list of all the projects can be found in the <a href="softwarehardware/">Software / Hardware</a> section.</p>
<p>And to not forget, all the code got written in a proof-of-concept context and therefore is not production-ready (yet).</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<h3 id="computing-at-the-edge">Computing at the Edge</h3>
<p>The dynamic nature of ever increasing traffic over mobile networks requires highly reactive backends. Things like video-caching, anomaly detection, efficient bandwidth management, or even routing has to be handled much closer to the enduser, to the enduser device.</p>
<p>Low latency requirements of many mobile related use-cases makes every roundtrip to the central data-center inefficient or even impossible, especially for any control flows.</p>
<h3 id="micro-server-in-every-device">Micro-server in every device</h3>
<p>In 2015 Facebook announced that they have built their own network switch. We obviously got curious about the reasons behind that decision. Luckily some insides can be found in a related blog post: "<a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/145488969140934/open-networking-advances-with-wedge-and-fboss/">Open networking advances with Wedge and FBOSS</a>‚Äù.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Many network operators we've spoken with share our goal of <strong>managing our networking devices and servers in the same way</strong>. With that goal in mind, we designed both <strong>Wedge</strong> and <strong>FBOSS</strong> to closely resemble server hardware and server software, which has <strong>enabled us to deploy, monitor, and control these systems alongside our servers and storage</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The disintegration in to individual dedicate hardware-components for switching and device management (BMC) allowed Facebook to use a regular off-the-shelf micro-server for the control-plane.</p>
<p>This Intel-based micro-server with 8gb RAM and 120gb SSD became the enabling piece for our ToRC architecture.</p>
<h3 id="build-ship-and-run-on-any-device">Build, ship, and run on any device</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.docker.com">Docker</a> changed the way we package, deploy, and run services. We are finally in a position where we can run the same package, the same container on a switch and a regular compute node independent of underlying Linux kernel and libraries. This simplifies and streamlines not just the deployment of services but also provides a unique opportunity to decide at run time where to place and run a service.</p>
<h3 id="metrics-driven-orchestration">Metrics-driven Orchestration</h3>
<h4 id="ease-of-metrics-collection">Ease of Metrics Collection</h4>
<p>Containers out of the box come with metrics (cpu, memory, network). For pretty much the first time we are able to easily collect metrics on a service level.</p>
<p>If we add metrics collected by the switch and metrics from the compute nodes and stream everything in to a time-series database we end up with the data needed for informed control, placement, and optimization decisions.</p>
<h4 id="orchestration-separation-of-concern">Orchestration - Separation of Concern</h4>
<p>It gets easily overlooked that controlling software running on an infrastructure level is different from controlling a 3-tier web application. Therefore many of the popular container-orchestrators are too limiting and can‚Äôt be used for our use-case.</p>
<p><a href="https://mesos.apache.org">Mesos</a> offers a unique and powerful separation between resource-management and orchestration/scheduling. Resource-management is done by Mesos and orchestration is handled by an individually implemented use-case specific scheduler, called Mesos-frameworks. Those Mesos-frameworks, like the ‚ÄúToRC Scheduler‚Äù, provide a nice and easy way to encapsulate the logic needed to make informed control and placement decisions for specific use-cases and applications.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts">Core Concepts</h2>
<p>A list of a few core concepts which serve as guiding principles for ToRC:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=".#autonomous-rack">Federation of Autonomous Racks</a></li>
<li><a href=".#top-of-rack-controller">Top-of-Rack Controller</a></li>
<li><a href=".#no-virtualization-minimal-abstraction">No virtualization, minimal abstraction</a></li>
<li><a href=".#unified-view-across-network-and-compute-state">Unified view across network and compute state</a></li>
<li><a href=".#extensive-collection-of-metrics">Extensive collection of metrics</a></li>
<li><a href=".#selective-state-replication-selective-routing">Selective state replication, selective routing</a></li>
<li><a href=".#scheduler-hierarchy-control-placement-optimization">Scheduler Hierarchy, Control - Placement - Optimization</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="federation-of-autonomous-racks">Federation of Autonomous Racks</h3>
<p>Each rack serves as a self-contained ‚Äúdatacenter‚Äù. It has all the core control and network functions needed to work as an autonomous entity.</p>
<p>Each rack controls the visibility of its services and state.</p>
<p>Racks can be bundled in groups. Groups share state in an eventual consistant way.</p>
<h3 id="top-of-rack-controller">Top-of-Rack Controller</h3>
<p>The unique location of the Top-of-Rack switch and its importance for the whole rack makes it a perfect fit for any core controller functionality.</p>
<h3 id="no-virtualization-minimal-abstraction">No virtualization, minimal abstraction</h3>
<p>To guarantee low latency and high resource efficiency we avoid any virtualization technology like VM or Overlay Network. </p>
<p>Docker is used to run services and L3 routing for its networking. Each container has its own routable IP address.</p>
<p>Our code is written in Rust and Go. Both languages generate binary executables.</p>
<p>We carefully try to avoid any additional abstraction layer. Our code has to be able to benefit from each and every feature the underlying network or compute hardware offers. </p>
<h3 id="extensive-collection-of-metrics">Extensive collection of metrics</h3>
<p>Realtime metrics are key for efficient orchestration. We collect  system, network, and container metrics and store them in a time-series database. Each rack has its own time-series database.</p>
<h3 id="unified-view-across-network-and-compute-state">Unified view across network and compute state</h3>
<p>Each rack maintains one unified view across states of all its different services, and network and compute resources. </p>
<h3 id="selective-state-replication-selective-routing">Selective state replication, selective routing</h3>
<p>Only a subset of the state gets shared between racks using replication. If a scheduler decides that one of its services needs to be reachable from the other racks its route gets announced via the shared state.</p>
<h3 id="scheduler-hierarchy-control-placement-optimization">Scheduler Hierarchy, Control - Placement - Optimization</h3>
<p>We implemented a 3 layer scheduler hierarchy.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ‚ÄúToRC Scheduler‚Äù runs on the switch and <strong>controls</strong> all the core services. It also handles all the interactions with the state database and the network-agent.</li>
<li>‚ÄúSub-schedulers‚Äù are responsible for the <strong>placement</strong> of services serving a specific use-case, like the <a href="example/dns/">DNS example</a>. ‚ÄúSub-schedulers‚Äù provide updates to the ToRC Scheduler about the state, placement, and configuration of their services.</li>
<li>‚ÄúOptimizers‚Äù constantly analyze the time-series data and the state of the rack. If they find a need for <strong>optimization</strong>, like scaling up a service or shutting off a node, they will interact with the correspondent scheduler to execute on those optimizations.</li>
</ul>
